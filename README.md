## Adding pre-commit hooks

You can add pre-commit hooks for checking and cleaning up your changes:

```
bash bin/install_pre_commit.sh
```

You can also run the following command to ensure all files adhere to coding conventions:

```
bash bin/cleanup_pre_commit.sh
```

This will autoformat your code, sort your imports and fix overal problems.
